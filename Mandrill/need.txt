Mandril is a tool which can automatic check the binary instruction code for the file genereted by cross-compile.

There are 3 purposes for using this tool:
1. We must check some reserve or functional bit of generated instructions, especially when you change some gcc source code;
2. We can use this tool to count the number of hazard may happen in assigning bin file;
3. It is very necessary to check opcode, funct and some other fields encode format just the same as the compiler supported.

Mandrill includes following functions:
1. format.py: the format of ISA, if you want to assign another ISA, correct the heading import is necessary;
